# Show-Element-By-Class-Name
There are different ways to find elements with values on a web page in JavaScript. One of the most common method is getElementById(), which finds elements using each elementâ€™s unique id. You can also find elements (a group of elements) using the class name. In such cases you can use the getElementsByClassName() method of document object in JavaScript.
